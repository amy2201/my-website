			<h2>Who are you?</h2>
			<div><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.amytranslates.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/me.jpg?resize=300%2C300" width="300" height="300" alt="A white woman with brown hair and blue eyes, who is wearing glasses, smiling at the camera"></div>
			<p>My name is Amy Louise Stevens. I'm 30 years old and I'm originally from Manchester in England, although now I live in Catalonia in the north of Spain. I've lived here for a total of 8 years, with a year out during that time to study in the UK and France. I'm always keen to learn new skills and meet new people, which is what led me to GitHub. I've been learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript since August 2022; so far, it's been very exciting and eye-opening. <div id="pdiv"></div></p>

			<h2>What do you do?</h2>
			<p>My formal education is in the field of translation and linguistics, and I worked for almost a decade in the translation sector, specialising in medical translation and literary translation. I now work as a technical writer, while continuing my work in writing and literary translation. You can view my professional website by following <a href="http://www.amytranslates.com/" target="_blank" title="Amy Stevens Translations">this link</a>.</div></p>
